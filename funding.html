		<h1>Funding Opportunities</h1>
		<div class="">
		The Experimental Humanities Collaborative Network promotes projects that encourage the following:<br>	
		<ol>
				<li>Critical reflection on the intersection of science, technology, media, art, and the humanities in response to the question: how does technology mediate what it means to be human?</li>
				<li> Hands-on and experiential learning: learning by doing, building, collaborating (between students, faculty, and/or staff), and experimenting.</li>
				<li> Critical, scholarly, and/or artistic work that crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries, especially between disciplines concerned with sciences & technology and disciplines concerned with the arts & humanities.
				</li>
				<li> Critical, scholarly, and/or artistic work that strives to make an impact on communities beyond the academy and that strives to promote a more equitable and just world.
				</li>
				<li> The creation of archives, pedagogical resources, research projects, and artworks that can be used and studied by partners across the EHCN.
				</li>
				<li> Projects that correspond to our three themed weeks for 2021-2022.
					<ul>
						<li>Humans and the Environment [tentatively 3/7-3/11]</li>
						<li>The Cultural Politics of Naming [tentatively 3/28-4/1]</li>
						<li>Reclaiming the Narrative [tentatively 5/2-5/6]</li>
					</ul>
				</li>  </ol>
				<p>The six numbered points above indicate the general “criteria” by which grant proposals to the EHCN will be evaluated. Not every project must satisfy all criteria, but priority will be given to proposals that take multiple criteria into consideration.</p>
			

			<p>The Steering Committee reserves the right to withhold part or all of the funds awarded until project expectations are satisfied. Awards cannot be carried over. All durable equipment purchased by EHCN funds will remain the property of OSUN/EHCN.
			</p><p>
			Awardees will be required to submit a final narrative and financial report on the successful completion of their project and will also be expected to share their work with the EHCN community through such outlets as the annual conference, research presentation, or online dissemination.	
			</p><p>
			Recipients of funds who are not US citizens are subject to administrative review. OSUN does not share any information on vetted individuals with the U.S. Government. This is an internal OSUN process, which screens program participants through Visual Compliance, a software system widely used by American higher education institutions.

				<h2><sup>* Network-wide  *</sup>PROJECT DEVELOPMENT & MATERIALS GRANTS </h2>

				<div class="inner">	 
					<p>Propose experimental research and artistic projects that bring local concerns, narratives, and resources to a global stage through public-facing exhibitions, publications, and archives or through new media technologies, such as podcasts, websites, and social media. Projects that feature multiple network partners working in collaboration will be prioritized. (If you have a project proposal but have not yet established a collaborative relationship throughout the EHCN, please indicate that in your application, and we will do our best to connect you with potential partners.)
					Eligibility: Faculty, staff and students at EHCN partner institutions

				<h2><sup>* Network-wide  *</sup>COURSE DEVELOPMENT GRANTS </h2>

				<div class="inner">	 
					<p>Develop new or adapt existing Experimental Humanities (EH)-related courses that will be linked across multiple network institutions. These courses should center on topics related to the intersection of the humanities, arts, sciences, and technology, and should not just use but also critically consider digital or analog technologies and their ramifications (for example, as mediums of communication, information-sharing, and surveillance). Successful course proposals will involve at least 2 network partners and should include practice-rich modules that students from various institutions can complete, ideally in collaboration with one another.
