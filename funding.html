			<h2>Experimental Humanities Collaborative Network Call for Local Proposals | 2021-23</h2>

			<div class="inner">

				The Experimental Humanities Collaborative Network promotes projects that encourage the following:<br>
				<ol>
				<li>Critical reflection on the intersection of science, technology, media, art, and the humanities in response to the question: how does technology mediate what it means to be human?</li>
				<li> Hands-on and experiential learning: learning by doing, building, collaborating (between students, faculty, and/or staff), and experimenting.</li>
				<li> Critical, scholarly, and/or artistic work that crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries, especially between disciplines concerned with sciences & technology and disciplines concerned with the arts & humanities.
				</li>
				<li> Critical, scholarly, and/or artistic work that strives to make an impact on communities beyond the academy and that strives to promote a more equitable and just world.
				</li>
				<li> The creation of archives, pedagogical resources, research projects, and artworks that can be used and studied by partners across the EHCN.
				</li>
				<li> Projects that correspond to our three themed weeks for 2021-2022.
					<ul>
						<li>Humans and the Environment [tentatively 3/7-3/11]</li>
						<li>The Cultural Politics of Naming [tentatively 3/28-4/1]</li>
						<li>Reclaiming the Narrative [tentatively 5/2-5/6]</li>
					</ul>
				</li>  </ol>
				The six numbered points above indicate the general “criteria” by which grant proposals to the EHCN will be evaluated. Not every project must satisfy all criteria, but priority will be given to proposals that take multiple criteria into consideration.

				<h2>Student-led Initiatives</h2>

				<div class="inner">
					<p>These funds will support undergraduate and graduate-student led projects and initiatives focused on the intersection of the arts, sciences, and humanities. Projects might strive to bring local concerns, narratives, and resources to a global stage through new media technologies including podcasts, websites, social media, and so forth during the 2021-22 and 2022-23 academic years. An example of a previously successful student-led initiative can be found here.</p>
					<p>
					Funds may be used for activities like starting student-groups interested in media or technology, interdisciplinary art projects, reading groups, or digital student publications/content creation. Students applying for this grant must identify a faculty member at Bard who can help them develop the project and mentor them throughout its execution.</p>
					<p>
					Applicants approved for a grant must submit a written report with relevant project documentation upon completion.</p>
					<em>Applicants may request up to $500 for their initiative.</em>
