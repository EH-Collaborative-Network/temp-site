		<h1>Funding Opportunities</h1>
		<div class="one-column">
		The Experimental Humanities Collaborative Network promotes projects that encourage the following:<br>	
		<ol>
				<li>Critical reflection on the intersection of science, technology, media, art, and the humanities in response to the question: how does technology mediate what it means to be human?</li>
				<li> Hands-on and experiential learning: learning by doing, building, collaborating (between students, faculty, and/or staff), and experimenting.</li>
				<li> Critical, scholarly, and/or artistic work that crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries, especially between disciplines concerned with sciences & technology and disciplines concerned with the arts & humanities.
				</li>
				<li> Critical, scholarly, and/or artistic work that strives to make an impact on communities beyond the academy and that strives to promote a more equitable and just world.
				</li>
				<li> The creation of archives, pedagogical resources, research projects, and artworks that can be used and studied by partners across the EHCN.
				</li>
				<li> Projects that correspond to our three themed weeks for 2021-2022.
					<ul>
						<li>Humans and the Environment [tentatively 3/7-3/11]</li>
						<li>The Cultural Politics of Naming [tentatively 3/28-4/1]</li>
						<li>Reclaiming the Narrative [tentatively 5/2-5/6]</li>
					</ul>
				</li>  </ol>
				<p>The six numbered points above indicate the general “criteria” by which grant proposals to the EHCN will be evaluated. Not every project must satisfy all criteria, but priority will be given to proposals that take multiple criteria into consideration.</p>
				Proposals are accepted by the below partners:
				<ul> 
					<li><a>American University of Central Asia</a></li>
					<li><a>Arizona State University</a></li>
					<li><a>Bard College Annandale</a></li>
					<li><a>Bard College Berlin</a></li>
					<li><a>Birkbeck College at the University of London</a></li>
					<li><a>Central European University</a></li>
					<li><a>European Humanities University</a></li>
				</ul>

			<p>The Steering Committee reserves the right to withhold part or all of the funds awarded until project expectations are satisfied. Awards cannot be carried over. All durable equipment purchased by EHCN funds will remain the property of OSUN/EHCN.
			</p><p>
			Awardees will be required to submit a final narrative and financial report on the successful completion of their project and will also be expected to share their work with the EHCN community through such outlets as the annual conference, research presentation, or online dissemination.	
			</p><p>
			Recipients of funds who are not US citizens are subject to administrative review. OSUN does not share any information on vetted individuals with the U.S. Government. This is an internal OSUN process, which screens program participants through Visual Compliance, a software system widely used by American higher education institutions.

				<h2>Student Research and <br>Professional Opportunities<sup>institution-specific*</sup></h2>

				<div class="inner">
					 
					<p>These grants can be used to support opportunities that connect undergraduate and graduate students interested in the Experimental Humanities from one EHCN institution to partner institutions on the network. These may be working/reading groups consisting of students from different EHCN institutions, or research programs or creative projects that see direct collaborations between members of different EHCN institutions. </p>
					<p>
					For example, funds may be used to help fund materials for a reading group, a topic-based club (video games, podcasting, surveillance), or a collaborative research project. They may also be used to help support a student who wishes to travel from one EHCN institution to a partner institution under the mentorship of a faculty member/adviser in order to complete research related to the Experimental Humanities. 
					</p><p>Funds may also be used to pay fees and travel costs associated with participating in Experimental Humanities-related programs/events at partner institutions (such as the Pelion Summer Lab in Thessaly, Greece, the London Critical Theory Summer School at Birkbeck, or the EHU DAAD Summer School), or to facilitate collaborations among undergraduate students and/or graduate students at partner institutions in the form of student-run conferences, symposia, podcasts, social media projects, publications, art exhibitions, etc.   
					</p><p>Applicants approved for a grant must submit a written report with relevant project documentation upon completion.</p>
					<p><em>Applicants may request up to $3000 per proposal. </em></p>
