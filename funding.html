		<h1>Funding Opportunities</h1>
		<div class="two-column">
		The Experimental Humanities Collaborative Network provides funding to support an array of innovation-encouraging micro-grants both locally at each of our partner institutions and across our network. Our institution-specific grant lines are essential for promoting student- and faculty-driven projects that play to the strengths of each individual institution. These grants enable more dynamic, participatory curricular offerings and become a way for community members at each institution to develop connections to EHCN and OSUN in general. Our network-wide grant lines support EHCN’s largest and most ambitious projects, and they emphasize collaborative, cross-network initiatives between two or more EHCN partners.<br><br>
		<section>
		We promote projects that inspire:<br>	
		<ol>
				<li>Critical reflection on the intersection of science, technology, media, art, and the humanities in response to the question: <strong>how does technology mediate what it means to be human?</strong></li>
				<li> Hands-on and <strong>experiential learning</strong>: learning by doing, building, collaborating (between students, faculty, and/or staff), and experimenting.</li>
				<li> Critical, scholarly, and/or artistic <strong>work that crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries</strong>, especially between disciplines concerned with sciences & technology and disciplines concerned with the arts & humanities.
				</li>
				<li> Critical, scholarly, and/or artistic work that strives to make an impact on communities <strong>beyond the academy</strong> and that strives to promote a more equitable and just world.
				</li>
				<li> The <strong>creation of archives, pedagogical resources, research projects, and artworks</strong> that can be used and studied by partners across the EHCN.
				</li>
				 </ol>
				<p>The five numbered points above indicate the general “criteria” by which grant proposals to the EHCN will be evaluated. Not every project must satisfy all criteria, but priority will be given to proposals that take multiple criteria into consideration.</p>

				<h2>PROJECT DEVELOPMENT & MATERIALS GRANTS </h2>

				<div class="inner">	 
					<p>Propose experimental research and artistic projects that bring local concerns, narratives, and resources to a global stage through public-facing exhibitions, publications, and archives or through new media technologies, such as podcasts, websites, and social media. Projects that feature multiple network partners working in collaboration will be prioritized. (If you have a project proposal but have not yet established a collaborative relationship throughout the EHCN, please indicate that in your application, and we will do our best to connect you with potential partners.)<br><br>

				<h2>COURSE DEVELOPMENT GRANTS </h2>

				<div class="inner">	 
					<p>Develop new or adapt existing Experimental Humanities (EH)-related courses that will be linked across multiple network institutions. These courses should center on topics related to the intersection of the humanities, arts, sciences, and technology, and should not just use but also critically consider digital or analog technologies and their ramifications (for example, as mediums of communication, information-sharing, and surveillance). Successful course proposals will involve at least 2 network partners and should include practice-rich modules that students from various institutions can complete, ideally in collaboration with one another.<br><br>

				<h2>TOPIC-BASED WORKING GROUPS </h2>

				<div class="inner">	 
					<p>Establish topic-based working groups that center on the collaborative study of technology, justice, and the human experience. Proposed working groups must include members from at least 2 network institutions and should arise out of interdisciplinary faculty, staff and/or student interests (such as Archives, Attention, Food, Migration, and Space & Politics). Working groups may be structured to yield new linked courses, published research, collaborative projects, grant proposals, and public-facing events.<br><br>

				<h2><sup>* Institution-specific *</sup>Student Research and Professional Opportunities</h2>

				<div class="inner">
					 
					<p>These grants can be used to support opportunities that connect undergraduate and graduate students interested in the Experimental Humanities from one EHCN institution to partner institutions on the network. These may be working/reading groups consisting of students from different EHCN institutions, or research programs or creative projects that see direct collaborations between members of different EHCN institutions. </p>
					<p>
					For example, funds may be used to help fund materials for a reading group, a topic-based club (video games, podcasting, surveillance), or a collaborative research project. They may also be used to help support a student who wishes to travel from one EHCN institution to a partner institution under the mentorship of a faculty member/adviser in order to complete research related to the Experimental Humanities.  
					</p><p>Funds may also be used to pay fees and travel costs associated with participating in Experimental Humanities-related programs/events at partner institutions (such as the <a href="https://www.pelionsummerlab.net/" target="_blank">Pelion Summer Lab in Thessaly, Greece</a>, the <a href="https://www.bbk.ac.uk/annual-events/london-critical-theory-summer-school" target="_blank">London Critical Theory Summer School at Birkbeck</a>, or the <a href="https://en.ehu.lt/academics/daad-go-east-summer-school/" target="_blank">EHU DAAD Summer School</a>), or to facilitate collaborations among undergraduate students and/or graduate students at partner institutions in the form of student-run conferences, symposia, podcasts, social media projects, publications, art exhibitions, etc.
