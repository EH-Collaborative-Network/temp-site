		<h1>About EHCN</h1>
		<div class="two-column">
			<p>How does technology mediate what it means to be human? How have scientific, intellectual, and artistic experiments reshaped human experience in diverse historical and cultural contexts, and how might they shape our shared futures?</p>

			<p>Experimental Humanities Collaborative Network (EHCN) supports innovative and interdisciplinary research at the intersection of the arts, technology, and the humanities; pedagogy that emphasizes skills-based learning with a range of technologies, critical reflection, and social justice; and digital and face-to-face public projects that promote civic engagement in order to imagine more just technological realities. As part of the Open Society University Network (OSUN), the EHCN also aims to ground its work in endeavors that link scholars and students from different institutions in long- and short-term projects and collaborations.</p>

			<p>EHCN insists on the power of grassroots leadership, and invites an array of collaborators to the table. Its courageous—and often playful—experimentation with both “old” and “new” technologies flattens hierarchies not just between academic disciplines but between the academy and local communities. Not only working with each partner institution to emphasize its unique local technological, environmental, and cultural ecology, EHCN also creates opportunities for partners to share the lessons of their distinctive experiences with a larger global community.</p>

He has nearly completed his first monograph, tentatively titled "Discomposing Shakespeare: Studying Early Modern Literature at the Scene of Writing," which argues that studying the writing habits of Renaissance poets can help address the contradictions inherent to writing instruction in the modern literature classroom. </p>',
    		"Saida Hamad": "Al-Quds Bard<br><p>Saida is a Lecturer and Head of the Media Studies at Al-Quds Bard (AQB). She majored in English Literature at Arizona State University for her BA and later obtained a Master's Degree in International Studies at BirZeit University. She has nearly thirty years of experience as a distinguished journalist and Media and Communication Specialist in some of the most leading organizations, including the World Bank, AL Hayat Newspaper (London-based), TF1 (French TV), ABC News, and ITN. Throughout her years of experience, Saida has accumulated a wide range of knowledge in the world of media and a diverse set of communication and analytical skills, of which she passionately transferred to her students at AQB. Saida’s teaching experience at Palestinian universities, including AL Quds Open University and BirZeit University (BZU) enhanced her commitment to further pursue and build her career in the academic field, promote knowledge and critical thinking skills, challenge the traditional media teaching methods in Palestine, and create new programs that enable students to creatively express themselves as journalists and reach a wider audience.</p><p>Joining AQB as a lecturer and head of the Media Studies program in the Humanities Practicing Arts Division in 2019, Saida attracted 40 students to the Introduction of Media Studies course. Given her experience and expertise in journalism, Saida revised the entire Media Studies program to further enhance the AQB’s innovative liberal arts education approach. This included adding new interdisciplinary courses, restructuring the academic plan, and diversifying topics across the department to meet the new challenges of the world of Media. She invited high-level guest speakers to AQB, thereby connecting the college more directly to the Palestinian media community in general. As head of the media program, Saida has incorporated excellent visiting faculty to strengthen the program and has an active role in several pedagogy and organizational College Committees. With the collaboration from her colleagues, Saida is now leading the creation of the Online Bilingual Art & Culture multimedia Journal Hannoon. The journal aims to critically engages Palestinian artistic and cultural life across its many forms and fora. Before joining AQB, Saida lectured at Birzeit University (BZU) where she focused on integrating Information Technology, namely Web, Data, and Mobile journalism, with classic journalism. Specifically, Saida developed new interactive teaching methods in which students simulate a daily “editorial meeting” where they collectively overview and discuss local and international news, and work on writing their own news pieces. Moreover, she introduced the concept of multimedia production of news in the Journalism Lab, where students had to produce both infographic and video-graphic materials to reach a wider range of audience in the world of new media. During her time at BZU, Saida worked with her students to create, write, design, and publish two magazines per semester. These courses provided the students with realistic, interactive, practical, and fundamental tools to utilize in their future careers.Prior to teaching at BZU, she worked as a Chief Editor and Programs Director and Presenter at Wattan Palestinian TV station. Saida also worked as a Results Reporting and Communications Specialist for the USAID Palestinian Health Sector Reform and Development Project (2009- 2011).

    		"Gwyneira Isaac": "National Museum of Natural History<br><p>Gwyneira Isaac is a cultural anthropologist and Curator of North American Ethnology at the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) at the Smithsonian Institution. Her research investigates the dynamics of and intersections between culturally different knowledge systems. Central to this study is her ethnography of a tribal museum in the Pueblo of Zuni, New Mexico, Mediating Knowledges: Origins of a Museum for the Zuni People (2007), in which she examines the challenges faced by Zunis operating between Zuni and Anglo-American approaches to knowledge. Her explorations into these knowledge intersections (either culturally or disciplinarily distinct), include how technology and media are used within the discipline of anthropology. She looks at the different values attributed to the reproduction of knowledge as explored through museum replicas in ‘Whose Ideas Was This?’ Replicas, Museums and the Reproduction of Knowledge’ (2012), as well as “Perclusive Alliances: Digital 3-D, Museums and the Reconciling of Culturally Diverse Knowledges” (2015). Currently, she is researching the history of face casting in the 19th and 20th century and the intersectional histories these now engage, where descendant communities, physical anthropologists and museums grapple with the legacies of these duplicated bodies. As part of the Recovering Voices program she helps to lead at the NMNH, she is working on exploring the use of collections by Native American communities within their cultural revitalization efforts. As part of this effort, in 2012, she formed the Health and Culture Research Group (HCRG) to bridge Anglo-American and Indigenous approaches to Native American health issues.</p><p>The project she brings to the EHCN OSUN group, To Be—Named, looks at the cultural politics of naming, especially via the intersections between different disciplinary naming practices, colonizing and decolonizing naming practices, as well as issues around naming and race. The aim of the project is to build bridges between the academy and diverse and Indigenous communities, as well as to find multi-modal methods, media and technologies that will help creatively and ethically assemble, exchange and build understanding around responsibilities towards knowledge diversity.</p><br><a href='https://naturalhistory.si.edu/staff/gwyneira-isaac'>https://naturalhistory.si.edu/staff/gwyneira-isaac</a>",

Threads weaving their way throughout her thinking and research include: the co-constitution of the technological and the political, mediation as a cultural process, the ethics and responsibilities of witnessing and the structures of power that produce alterity. In addition to a Greek-language volume, entitled Digital Ethnography (2015), Penelope has written numerous articles on affective publics and social grief, visuality and violence, public death and mourning of the precarious Other and necropolitics in the context of critical media events, network culture and database aesthetics.</p><p>Penelope is particularly interested in exploring the possibilities of digital technologies in pedagogy, research, dissemination, and co-production of scholarship, the transformation of narrative in the age of database, and expanding the agenda of experimental humanities. These impulses for collaboration, conviviality and public-facing academic engagement have found expression, elaboration and inspiration in the <a href='https://www.pelionsummerlab.net/'>Pelion Summer Lab for Cultural Theory and Exoerimental Humanities Lab</a> and the “confestival” <a href='https://datastoriesconfestival.weebly.com/'>Data-Stories</a>.
